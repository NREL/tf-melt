The examples folder includes a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the 
use of the TF-MELT package for different machine learning tasks. The examples included
are:

- **Regression (regression.ipynb)**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the TF-MELT
  package for regression tasks. The notebook uses each of the models available in
  TF-MELT and showcases the use of uncertainty quantification for each of the model
  types. The notebook demonstrates the entire typical workflow for ML regression:

    - Data creation
    - Data preprocessing
    - Model creation
    - Model training
    - Model evaluation
    - Visualizing model results
